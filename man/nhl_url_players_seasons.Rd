\title{Create an NHL API URL for  players' seasons statistics}
\usage{
nhl_url_players_seasons(playerIds, seasons, playoffs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{playerIds}{\code{integer()}, vector of one or more ids of the
players. The ids correspond to the ids expected by the NHL
API's people endpoint. For most cases the \code{playerNames} argument
can be provided for more convenient usage.}

\item{seasons}{\code{numeric()}, vector of starting years of desired
seasons in \code{YYYY} format, e.g. \code{1995} for season 1995-1996.
Accepts vectors such as \code{c(1995:2000, 2010)}.

Alternatively, also accepts \code{character()} with seasons in the
format \code{"YYYYZZZZ"}, where ZZZZ = YYYY + 1, e.g. \code{"19951996"}.
This is the format that ultimately gets sent to the NHL API.}

\item{playoffs}{\code{logical(1)} if \code{FALSE} (default) get the regular
seasons data, if \code{TRUE}, get the data for the playoffs.}
