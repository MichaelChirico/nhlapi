\title{Get team statistics per seasons}
\usage{
nhl_teams_stats(teamIds = NULL, seasons = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{teamIds}{\code{integer()}, ids of the teams or \code{NULL} (default)
for all teams. As of end of 2019, the valid team ids seem to be
in the \code{1:54} range.}

\item{seasons}{\code{numeric()}, vector of starting years of desired
seasons in \code{YYYY} format, e.g. \code{1995} for season 1995-1996.
Accepts vectors such as \code{c(1995:2000, 2010)}.

Alternatively, also accepts \code{character()} with seasons in the
format \code{"YYYYZZZZ"}, where ZZZZ = YYYY + 1, e.g. \code{"19951996"}.
This is the format that ultimately gets sent to the NHL API.

Some API endpoints, notably \code{seasons} exposed via \code{nhl_seasons()}
also allow the value \code{"current"} to passed.}
